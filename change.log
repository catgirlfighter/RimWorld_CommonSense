- updated french translation.

1.3.10
- made a minor change to reduce the fallout that mostly affects my mental state than anything else, connected to a problem with compatibility issue with some unknown mod that affects unequipping (making pawns stack equipping and unequipping non-stop).

1.3.9
- improved compatibility with autonomous buildings (like gestators), contribution by @ArcaneZedric;
- made so if an option to mark items for unloading is switched off pawns won't pick up and drop items that are marked for unloading in a cycle anymore. It's not a problem that I can fix because that's a mod order issue with a mod that I don't even know a name of;
- fixed switching off cleaning gizmo doing nothing.

1.3.8.0
- added safe exit from JobDriver_SocialRelax_CommonSense driver to transition into regular one.

1.3.8
- fixed SocialRelax giving less joy. Also don't get scared by missing def at loading the save first time. It's normal.

1.3.7
- update for chinese traditional by @kkosos. Thank you!

1.3.6
- another attempt to rework visualisation of "inbetween" cleaning to improve compotubility.

1.3.5
- fixed pawns sometimes not using full cost to make an item;
- fixed pawns using wrong primary material to make an item;
- made so "safe wander" doesn't let to walk in vaacum;

1.3.4
- allegedly fixed a problem that caused 10 jobs per tick issue;
- made some mostly cosmetic changes to SocialRelax job;

1.3.3
- thanks @llunak for contribution;
- complete chinese simplified by @qqcswc. Thank you!;

1.3.2
- fixed fridge room having way too high of a score;

1.3.1
- minor changes for the sake of easier compatibility.

1.3.0
- 1.6. I wouldn't expect EVERYTHING to work rightaway though.

other
- added load order hint to load this mod before hospitality mod;

1.2.13
- made so "in-between" cleaning takes into account cleaning efficiency.

1.2.12
- little fix to take into account that some modded in coolers may have the same class as vanilla electric cooler but in fact have very little in common with it.

1.2.11
- made so an option to prefer close to spoiling meals is a bit more aggressive;
- made more nullckecks for meditation patch, to probably fix a problem that may be happening;

1.2.10
- removed duplicate of add_meal_ingredients option;
- fixed a very specific crash. It appears ONLY if you've saved under specific conditions and then loaded the game. So this crash can happen ONLY soon after loading the game. With conditions so ideal for debugging can't believe nobody sent me a save for checking sooner... All thanks to @Moonchill for showing bravery in these trying times. Anyway, probably should be better now. You might need to draft-undraft your pawns before unpausing for one last time, to clear out bugged tasks (if it helped you before, you definitely a victim of this bug).

1.2.9
- added new type of room - fridge room. It forms if it has adjusted coolers that set to cool the room below zero;
- "polite_wander" now avoids walking into fridge rooms and containment cells. Don't forget that pawns still can WANDER THROUGH these rooms;

1.2.8++
- anoher follow up for "optimal patching", accidentaly broke Dubs BG;

1.2.8+
- follow up for "optimal patching" option, regarding some comaptability patches;

1.2.8
- fixed settings not showing number options;
- added new option "optimal patching". It supposed to mimic what OwlChemist's fork did. Simply put, when option is toggled on, game doesn't patch in disabled options when restarted. Credit to OwlChemist where it's due;
- did some other stuff you probably won't notice;

1.2.7+
- updated last version of the mod for 1.4 version of the game. Managed to leave debug messages;

1.2.7
- fixed an option "to respect inventory capacity" not saving;

1.2.6
- thanks to contributor named 无声飞雪 I've managed to get an insight into issue related to "staning still" when an option to prefer spoiling ingredients is enabled. Made a fix, should work?

1.2.5
- further changes to previous update, it didn't do all the checks required. Not sure if it fixes anything though.

1.2.4
- made some changes to how ingredients are looked for. I dislike that pawns usually consider only a heap of things close to each other and disregard other items that are on the same stack or in the same shelf group. I've added an experimental feature to check ALL items in the same stockpile as the starter ones. It should improve how pawns look for "about to spoil" ingredients.

1.2.3
- made it so "put it back to inventory" option only works for player faction pawns;
- fixed and error "number of parameters specified does not match the expected number" when trying to cleant after tending to the patient. Fix by @tk421storm.

1.2.2
- supposedly fixed queuing issue;

1.2.1
- handled a situation in which "{} did not have work settings initialized" error could accure.

1.2.0
- I was worried it'll be hard to update it for 1.5, but it somehow have been actually easy... Not sure if anything broke so keep the eye out. Maybe DLC will the hard part.

other
- translation corrections;

1.1.63
- fixed slaves not cleaning opportunistically;

1.1.62
- Fix NREs breaking bill menu window contributed by @Thorbane;

1.1.61
- added paranoid checks to summary generation;
- changed prefix to posfix in summary generation, since game now has its own custom summaries for a lot of things;

1.1.60
- fixed "ingest any drugs" option. Vanilla still doesn't allow to ingest "medical" drugs (like luciferum) from inventory;
- fixed meditation_economy flag. @fyaunen reminded me that I forgot to make it work;
- reverted changes regarding meal stacking. Non-ideology still needs it. Sorry for ever removing it and taking so long to revert it;

1.1.59
- added clean gizmo to brewery and other buildings like it;

1.1.58
- possibly fixed an issue when pawn already had some ingredients in inventory, and picking up more would combine them, causing pawn to not use it in recipe as result;

1.1.57
- fixed a problem with pawns getting stuck when gestator already has all ingredients inside. Thanks, @Kulfyr3.

1.1.56 and a half
- seems to be fixed a problem causing items to disappear or make crafting items almost free;

1.1.56
- potentially fixed a problem with pawns trying to use ingredients from their inventory;

1.1.55
- cached all (two and a half) textures for quick access;
- removed meal stacking options because they don't make sense anymore. It's vanilla now;
- added some visual when pawns load items to their backpack;
- made a tiny adjustment to an option for pawns to carry stuff to stockpile before job. Now pawns should be reluctant to do that if overall ingredients are closer to work place than a stack;
- pawns incapable of hauling don't use "haul to stockpile" option anymore;
- pawns that can't use "unload inventory" logic can't use "carry all ingredients" option anymore (because when interrupted ingredients get stuck in inventory);
- there is an option to make pawns respect inventory limitations for carrying stuff to the station. On by default;
- added an option to prevent pawns from getting stuck meditating for no reason;
- pawns need for joy priority under sleep assignment now the same as in vanilla when "fun_police" option is disabled;

1.1.54
- RPGInventory (revamped) integrity things;
- fixed a problem with pawns moving ingredients to and from a bench on a loop. Thanks to @Des and his pawn Buggy for hooking me up with something substantial to work with!

- pawns now clean doorways in the rooms.

1.1.52
- fixed an error when pawns tried to operate already filled gestator;
- made so pawns start cleaning around bill station without going to it first;
- fixed stacking/splitting warning;

1.1.51
- in my defense, I didn't even have a clue what's gestator when I was making fixes for the patch, lol;

1.1.50
- wasn't long until first bug. Fixed pawns getting stuck trying to do bills (cooking and etc);

1.1.49
- updated for 1.4. Does everything (or anything) works properly? I have no idea! Enjoy the new patch and upcoming fixes! I sure will.

1.1.48+
- minor addition to make opportunistic cleaning ignore the gizmo toggle if gizmo is hidden;

1.1.48
- imagine doing something pointless without breaking anything in the process. Fixed the thing that wasn't supposed to be broken;
- made so basic opportunistic cleaning also respects cleaning toggle for buildings. It's possible now to add cleaning gizmo to other buildings to influence the behavior;

1.1.47
- did some pointless stuff that does nothing to the mod;
- made so you could define which actions should always or never use opportunistic cleaning through xml patching (example included);

1.1.46
- fixed put back to backpack option not disabling. I guess people never cared to return vanilla behavior until now;

1.1.45
- compatibility improvements for inventory management;

1.1.44+
- chinese translation corrections;

1.1.44
- attempted to fix pawns trying to pick up reserved meals;

1.1.43
- changed, how using drugs to cheer up patients works. Used to work through standard JoyGiver_TakeDrug, but since Chemical idiot pawns straight forward ignore everything when it comes to drugs, doctors would feed them every joy drug possible regardless of rules. I've made a new JoyGiver_TakeDrug_Patient that works only within the mod and doesn't let chemically stupid pawns to have their way;

1.1.42
- changed "opportunistic task skipped" message from error to a warning, made so after that message action reverts to vanilla;
- took into account that pawns might not have "needs" at all;

1.1.41
- removed unstackable ingredients from random pool;
- added eating from dispenser to the advanced cleaning list;

1.1.40
- made ordering suggestions for andorid mods;
- added PrisonerConvert to the cleaning list;
- added PrisonerEnslave to the cleaning list;
- added SpectateCeremony to the cleaning list;
- added DeliverFood to the cleaning list (although it counts as "before task", pawns actually clean after delivery);
- fixed moonwalking (if you know what I mean);
- fixed pawns standing still under a rain if they're kind of too far for proper safe place;

1.1.39
- [1.3] adjusted food optimality of spoiling meals for new formula in 1.3;

other
- added spanish translation;

1.1.38
- [1.3] fixed ingredient spoiling preferability;

1.1.37+
- fixed settings GUI;

1.1.37
- so anyways 1.3;

1.1.36
- fixed an issue, due to which pawns wouldn't clean around benches that for some reason don't or can't have a gizmo when their use is active;

1.1.35+
- french translation by qux;

1.1.35
- added synergy with sidearms to work with unload button;

1.1.34
- added compatibility with "awesome inventory" mod (to display "unload" button);
- fixed "polite_wander" would save and load as "safe_wander";
- added an option to allow any drugs to be taken from inventory (misc category). Ironically, does nothing for "awesome inventory";
- added an option to show a toggle using which you can disable cleaning around some benches;

1.1.33
- made a tiny fix for an option to look for joy outdoors: algorithm now will skip erroneous jobs;

1.1.32
- made so pawns naturally not affected by mood wouldn't use "avoid bad weather" unless it's a toxic fallout. Non-organic pawns don't care about toxic fallout either;
- made so pawns avoid standing in doorways when they use "avoid bad weather" logic;
- added an option for friendly pawns to avoid wandering into bedrooms, prison cells and prison barracks;

1.1.31
- made so pawns wouldn't use "avoid bad weather" logic when "on duty";
- made an option to disable "avoid bad weather". It seems I'm quite forgetful about stuff like that lately;

1.1.30+
- tiny fix to "avoid bad weather" option - made so pawns will search for home only roofed cells when caught under open sky;

1.1.30
- "display category" now shows all categories (if there a multiple) in full description;
- added an option for pawns to avoid bad weather when idling;
- did some changes to "cleaning before eating or relaxing" to make it more efficient;

1.1.29+
- forgot to actually add an option to disable mood regen. Added it and disabled by default (because for unknown reason it does bad things to fps for some people);

1.1.29
- added an option to clean rooms where pawns are planning to eat (normally or when relaxing socially). Doesn't look very nice so it's disabled by default;
- removed an option to prefer feeding animals with plant matter. Moved that functionaly to the new mod AnimalControls;
- added an option for pawn's mood to move towards resting point while they sleep (but only if potential mood allows it). Means instead of "freezing" when pawn is a sleep, mood will slowly move towards 50% point.

1.1.28
- added "talk to prisoner" to pre-cleaning tasks list;
- added an option for pawns to give joy drugs or food to sick pawns instead of just talking to them;
- added an option to change, how social relaxation uses drugs in order to avoid "wasting joy";

1.1.27+
- updated for 1.2;
- fixed HugLib's complain about patching obsolete methods;

1.1.26
- added a fix suggested by @BryanAldrich that supposed to fix some issue with forming a caravan;

1.1.25
- made a minor tweak that might or might not help people with their "pawns feed trees to animals" issue;

1.1.24
- fixed random ingredients appearing for cooked meals (caused by changes in 1.1);
- fixed pawns not prioritizing faster spoiling ingredients (caused by changes in 1.1);

1.1.23
- officially added Harmony dependency. Now this mod requires a Harmony mod to work properly. Nothing really changed, because this mod've used Harmony assemblies since the beginning anyway;
- changed, how actions are added to queue to be active after cleaning. Before they was added FORCED, so pawn could understand if he should try to take an opportunistic task again (opportunistic tasks are not taken for FORCED tasks). Now tasks are added to queue normally, and pawns also don't take opportunistic actions that was triggered from queue. It was changed so animals that set to follow pawns when they're on the job wouldn't "follow" the pawn WHILE he's asleep.
- fixed an unintended ability to unload locked out items (from quest characters and etc). New feature that wasn't taken into account after adaptation to a new version;
- fixed a bug that caused pawns to drop and pick up an item indefinitely when unloading. Item drop now triggered by different means than it used to be in 1.0.

1.1.22
- Updated for RimWorld 1.1! Now, that doesn't mean it works at least as good as before, because some things may be broken silently, without me knowing about it, so it may take a bit more time to fine tune everything.

1.1.21
- updated simplified chinese translation. Thanks, HawnHan.

1.1.20
- opportunistic task checker now reverts to default activity if error is occurred (i. e. instead of getting stuck in one error, it'll at least try to avoid it by leaving the rest to default behavior);

1.1.19
- increased interest of animals towards growing plants (over hay);

1.1.18
- separated options to prefer spoiling ingredients and meals;
- added an option that allows pawns to feed animals with hay (and other plants that animals NORMALLY eat). Pawns also gonna PREFER feeding animals with hay (and animals gonna prefer plants over other sources of food). Kind of goes against my understanding, how taming should work (or how normal animal logic should happen), but that balance issue is too minor for me to take immediate action (maybe later).

1.1.17
- added an option to prevent pawns from cleaning snow when it's... snowing. Or raining. In case if it's an uncertain weather.

1.1.16
- changed a thing about pathfinding to be wary of any kind of danger (not just "some") when looking for dirt;

1.1.15
- fixed a minor incompatibility issue with Simple Food Priorities. SFP makes so pawns think that eating unprepared food isn't weird (conditionally), but counting nutrients in inventory still worked the old way. Added additional check to prevent pawns from taking food that is excluded from counting when pawn attempt to pick up meal "in advance".

1.1.14
- fixed the broken fix that supposed to make so prioritization of spoiling medicine didn't count for surgeries. It ended up another way around;
- cleaning opportunities now ignored if it's an errand to build something;

1.1.13
- added a fix for an issue, that caused problems with opportunistic hauling before collecting items to a working place;

1.1.12
- made so doctors don't prioritize faster spoiling medicine for surgeries anymore;
- made so pawns, that require medical attention, don't do opportunistic cleaning errands;
- made so doctors don't clean after tending if their next job is also tending on a pawn that's in the same room or if it's an emergency (bleeding time < 6 hours). Keep in mind that it DOESN'T change, how doctors chose their patients.

1.1.11
- fixed that one thing that broke carpenter's table mod.

1.1.10
- removed empty space at place of a button in inventories for items that can't be marked to unload;
- made so that unstackable "single" items aren't placed in inventory when carried to a crafting place. That way designations on an item aren't canceled, and pawns will not try to "return" corpses and chucks into inventory when an action is canceled;

1.1.9
- fixed an issue, due to which pawns would reserve a stack of materials even if they already took a portion required from it;

1.1.8
- found a reason, why pawns ignored filth limit. They actually did, but since before starting a job they started cleaning again, they just got into restarting loop until room is cleaned. Added forced "add to queue" and marked queued job to be "forced", so pawns wouldn't try to clean after. Hope it doesn't lead to weird interactions;
- also made better checks to ignore non-player pawns earlier;

1.1.7
- changed numbers for opportunistic cleaning (again). Now it's 5 filth patches for everything, except tending (it's unlimited still);
- now you can set your own flith limits in mod settings;

1.1.6
- when pawns unload inventory, their task actually gets canceled midway if you unmark items or drop them;
- if you unmark items to unload, and pawn doesn't have enough space in inventory, that item is dropped on the ground;

1.1.5
- added some more checks for "random ingredients", to possibly remove any issues with unusual recipes;
- rearranged checks for opportunistic cleaning jobs to remove possibilities of pawns ignoring assignments in incapability;

1.1.4c
- a small fix for options that didn't save their state;

1.1.4b
- fixed "WashAtCell" issues on maps with no dedicated cleaning place (i.e. only wells or open water);

1.1.4a
- added an ignore of an error doring ThinkNode patch. 

1.1.4
- when recreating, colonists will prefer taking spare meals if they don't have one;
- fixed a problem, due to which colonists would prefer herbal medicine over any other when doing surgery;
- added a special patch for "dubs bad hygiene" that tweaks assignment priorities (pawns now will prefer to top off all needs during recreation and when not sleeping during sleeping assignment);

1.1.3
- fixed a problem, when material of an item could change with "all components hauled together" on, because order of picking up could change due to path optimization (basically, whatever was closer to the pawn, it automatically become a main ingredient);

1.1.2a
- limited filth cleaning opportunity to 20 (except tending);

1.1.2
- changed pawn priorities for sleeping schedule. Now they'll prioritize topping off joy need if they happen to wake up early;
- added an option to prevent colonists from taking joy activities if they're already topped off (after reaching 95%, they'll not start it again until it's down to 80%);

1.1.1
- added category to item's info;
- added prioritization of spoiling herbal medicine and corpses;
- added prioritization of spoiling food (to eat before it turns bad);
- removed unintentional duplicate in settings;

1.1.0
- added an option to unload equipped items;
- made an option for manual unloading optional;
- added compatibility patch for RPG Style Inventory;
- added an option for pawns to put items back in inventory when they get interrupted (ex. when you draft them during consumption of a meal in the middle of nowhere);
- added an option do prevent pawns from taking more sweets than they can eat;

This is probably the final changes to the mod. For now I've fulfilled all I wanted. I'll make some refactoring and optimization, but I'm out of further ideas for new features :)

1.0.16a
- NOW actually added order optimization when a pawn is hauling ingredients for a recipe;
- added some little changes to merging rules for better compatibility (credits to lilwhitemouse).

1.0.16
- fixed an error on trying to cut stone chunks. Sorry about that;
- added an option to unload an item from an inventory (to the closest stockpile, instead of dropping on the ground).

1.0.15
- made "full recipe descriptions" for apparel simpler;
- added order optimization when a pawn is hauling ingredients for a recipe;
- optimized some things considering ingredients that was left in inventory if hauling was interrupted, but it's hardly noticeable.

1.0.14
- added an option to prefer faster spoiling ingredients for cooking;

1.0.13
- added an option to pick up ALL ingredients before hauling them to the crafting place;
- fixed possible issue with recreational drugs in inventory when "fulfilling outdoors" is triggered;

1.0.12b
- fixed a compatibility issue with "Stockpile Ranking" mod. Probably fixed an issue with Haul Explicitly;

1.0.12a
- updated chinese language;
- changed how cleaning path is calculated for cleaning tasks to reduce backtracking;

1.0.12
- added synergy between a mod "pick up and haul" and a tweak "haul instead of crafting";
- added a GUI tweak, that allows to display complete list of ingredients on recipe screen, instead of just vague "ingredients";
- added an advanced option to let pawns clean the room between hauling ingredients and actual crafting (with normal option they would clean before hauling). This tweak is heavy handed and may break mods that tweak bill jobs.

1.0.11
- add a new feature: pawns now can take into account "potential" mood, what should prevent them from overusing drugs to get above a set level;

1.0.10
- "hauling instead of crafting" now ignores ingredients that do not stack;

1.0.9
- added chinese simplified translation. Credits to 脑子疼 (chrisxlite);

1.0.8:
- added an option to encourage pawns haul things to stockpile if they find ingredients for cooking or crafting outside of a room with crafting station (or if a room is huge or outdoors). It helps to avoid situations, when pawns go to pick up 1-2 ingredients for crafting, instead of hauling a whole stack;
- did some cleaning to avoid some more potential errors;

1.0.7:
- little reshuffling in code for compatibility;

1.0.6:
- revorked, how cleaking job is assigned. Now it uses built in CleanFilth checks instead of it's own. This way, if CleanFilth is rewrited/replaced by a mod, CommonSense will use rules of another mod instead;

1.0.5:
- fixed allowed area cleaning issue;

1.0.4:
- pawns will not try to clean dirt outside of home area any more;
- made a limit, how big room can be. If room is > than 200 cells, pawns will clean only filth that is nearby. Due to added limitation, I also made so pawns will clean even if it's not a room;

1.0.3:
- added translation possibility;
- cleaned up settings;
- separated cleaning after tending as it's own option. Those, who disabled cleaning, sorry for inconvenience. You have to disable it again;
- added an option to generate random ingredients to non-crafted meals. Disabled by default;

1.0.2:
- added a behavior, according to which pawns gonna clean the place where they're supposed to operate a building, or if it's some sort of joy activity. Also pawns clean the room after tending to patient.

1.0.1:
- although still suboptimal, the way, how outdoor recreation is chosen, was significantly improved. Now pawns pick up any activity that would result in hanging out outdoors. It's suboptimal because they still can't chose items, it means they may skip activities, that sometimes done indoors. It would require too much coding and would make this mod likely to conflict with other mods, that's why first case is preferable. So, in order to avoid indecisiveness, don't make the same recreational items both indoors and outdoors ;)
