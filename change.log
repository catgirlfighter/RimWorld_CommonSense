1.1.4
- when recreating, colonists will prefer taking spare meals if they don't have one;
- fixed a problem, due to which colonists would prefer herbal medicine over any other when doing surgery;
- added a special patch for "dubs bad hygiene" that tweaks assignment priorities (pawns now will prefer to top off all needs during recreation and when not sleeping during sleeping assignment);

1.1.3
- fixed a problem, when material of an item could change with "all components hauled together" on, because order of picking up could change due to path optimization (basically, whatever was closer to the pawn, it automatically become a main ingredient);

1.1.2a
- limited filth cleaning opportunity to 20 (except tending);

1.1.2
- changed pawn priorities for sleeping schedule. Now they'll prioritize topping off joy need if they happen to wake up early;
- added an option to prevent colonists from taking joy activities if they're already topped off (after reaching 95%, they'll not start it again until it's down to 80%);

1.1.1
- added category to item's info;
- added prioritization of spoiling herbal medicine and corpses;
- added prioritization of spoiling food (to eat before it turns bad);
- removed unintentional duplicate in settings;

1.1.0
- added an option to unload equipped items;
- made an option for manual unloading optional;
- added compatibility patch for RPG Style Inventory;
- added an option for pawns to put items back in inventory when they get interrupted (ex. when you draft them during consumption of a meal in the middle of nowhere);
- added an option do prevent pawns from taking more sweets than they can eat;

This is probably the final changes to the mod. For now I've fulfilled all I wanted. I'll make some refactoring and optimization, but I'm out of further ideas for new features :)

1.0.16a
- NOW actually added order optimization when a pawn is hauling ingredients for a recipe;
- added some little changes to merging rules for better compatibility (credits to lilwhitemouse).

1.0.16
- fixed an error on trying to cut stone chunks. Sorry about that;
- added an option to unload an item from an inventory (to the closest stockpile, instead of dropping on the ground).

1.0.15
- made "full recipe descriptions" for apparel simpler;
- added order optimization when a pawn is hauling ingredients for a recipe;
- optimized some things considering ingredients that was left in inventory if hauling was interrupted, but it's hardly noticeable.

1.0.14
- added an option to prefer faster spoiling ingredients for cooking;

1.0.13
- added an option to pick up ALL ingredients before hauling them to the crafting place;
- fixed possible issue with recreational drugs in inventory when "fulfilling outdoors" is triggered;

1.0.12b
- fixed a compatibility issue with "Stockpile Ranking" mod. Probably fixed an issue with Haul Explicitly;

1.0.12a
- updated chinese language;
- changed how cleaning path is calculated for cleaning tasks to reduce backtracking;

1.0.12
- added synergy between a mod "pick up and haul" and a tweak "haul instead of crafting";
- added a GUI tweak, that allows to display complete list of ingredients on recipe screen, instead of just vague "ingredients";
- added an advanced option to let pawns clean the room between hauling ingredients and actual crafting (with normal option they would clean before hauling). This tweak is heavy handed and may break mods that tweak bill jobs.

1.0.11
- add a new feature: pawns now can take into account "potential" mood, what should prevent them from overusing drugs to get above a set level;

1.0.10
- "hauling instead of crafting" now ignores ingredients that do not stack;

1.0.9
- added chinese simplified translation. Credits to 脑子疼 (chrisxlite);

1.0.8:
- added an option to encourage pawns haul things to stockpile if they find ingredients for cooking or crafting outside of a room with crafting station (or if a room is huge or outdoors). It helps to avoid situations, when pawns go to pick up 1-2 ingredients for crafting, instead of hauling a whole stack;
- did some cleaning to avoid some more potential errors;

1.0.7:
- little reshuffling in code for compatibility;

1.0.6:
- revorked, how cleaking job is assigned. Now it uses built in CleanFilth checks instead of it's own. This way, if CleanFilth is rewrited/replaced by a mod, CommonSense will use rules of another mod instead;

1.0.5:
- fixed allowed area cleaning issue;

1.0.4:
- pawns will not try to clean dirt outside of home area any more;
- made a limit, how big room can be. If room is > than 200 cells, pawns will clean only filth that is nearby. Due to added limitation, I also made so pawns will clean even if it's not a room;

1.0.3:
- added translation possibility;
- cleaned up settings;
- separated cleaning after tending as it's own option. Those, who disabled cleaning, sorry for inconvenience. You have to disable it again;
- added an option to generate random ingredients to non-crafted meals. Disabled by default;

1.0.2:
- added a behavior, according to which pawns gonna clean the place where they're supposed to operate a building, or if it's some sort of joy activity. Also pawns clean the room after tending to patient.

1.0.1:
- although still suboptimal, the way, how outdoor recreation is chosen, was significantly improved. Now pawns pick up any activity that would result in hanging out outdoors. It's suboptimal because they still can't chose items, it means they may skip activities, that sometimes done indoors. It would require too much coding and would make this mod likely to conflict with other mods, that's why first case is preferable. So, in order to avoid indecisiveness, don't make the same recreational items both indoors and outdoors ;)
